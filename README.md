# Annotated Lipidomics Tools Guide

This repository lists the informatics software and tools for lipidomics mentioned
in the *Guiding the choice of informatics software and tools for lipidomics research applications*
paper published in 2022 (doi:[10.1038/s41592-022-01710-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01710-0)).

For each tools from the Lipidomics Tools Guide the [elixir_mappings.csv](elixir_mappings.csv) file
has links to three [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) resources:

* [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/): a curated, informative and educational resource on data and metadata standards, inter-related to databases and data policies
* [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/): essential scientific and technical information about software tools, databases and services for bioinformatics and the life sciences
* [TeSS: ELIXIR's Training Portal](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/): browsing, discovering and organising life sciences training resources, aggregated from ELIXIR nodes and 3rd-party providers
